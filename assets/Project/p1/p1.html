                <p class="noidung_mota p1">This project is a supermarket purchasing management system, helping to
                    track and
                    manage objects: employees, customers, shifts, goods and invoices, supporting more effective
                    monitoring and management of supermarkets. And this is also a final project for the Object Oriented
                    Programming subject. Developed in C# programming language according to the Object Oriented
                    Programming (OOP) model. The system provides functional facilities such as Add, Delete, Update data
                    for objects.</p>

                    Supporting many functions on the object using logical algorithms. The project scored 90/100. In
                    which
                    the code score accounts for 80% and the report score accounts for 20%. The score is based on the
                    logical
                    criteria of object-oriented programming, so there will not be too many requirements in the topic.

                <p class="p0">Project needs improvement</p>
                <p class="p1">Because when we implemented the project, our group was only first-year students, our
                    knowledge
                    of infomatics was not much, and the project was mainly used for the purpose of learning how to
                    practice
                    object-oriented coding more, so the project still had many shortcomings. An important shortcoming
                    was
                    the lack of inventory update function after sales and import activities. This resulted in the
                    inability
                    to connect to the database, and the inability to combine with a good interface. However, this is
                    still
                    one of the projects worth mentioning for myself in particular and the members of the group in
                    general.
